            <p>JavaScript array methods are built-in functions that allow efficient manipulation and traversal of
              arrays. They provide essential functionalities like adding, removing, and transforming elements, as well
              as searching, sorting, and iterating through array elements, enhancing code readability and productivity

              JavaScript provides a bunch of string methods for representing and manipulating strings. From retrieving
              specific characters with charAt(), converting strings to uppercase with toUpperCase(), to combining
              strings with concat(), these methods simplify a wide range of tasks for developers.

              A promise in JavaScript is like a container for a future value. It is a way of saying, “I don’t have this
              value right now, but I will have it later.” Imagine you order a book online. You don’t get the book right
              away, but the store promises to send it to you. While you wait, you can do other things, and when the book
              arrives, you can read it.

              Async and Await in JavaScript is used to simplify handling asynchronous operations using promises. By
              enabling asynchronous code to appear synchronous, they enhance code readability and make it easier to
              manage complex asynchronous flows.

              JavaScript is designed to handle asynchronous programming which allows us to perform multiple tasks at
              once without blocking the main execution thread. Callbacks are fundamental in this context, as they
              enable.

              Objects in JavaScript are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
              Unlike primitive data types, which hold a single
              value, objects can hold multiple values as properties. This makes objects incredibly useful for grouping
              related data and operations.
